Hello! This is my first attempt at using HTML to construct a website. This is definitely a brutalistic approach for someone who is a huge believer in modern approaches to websites but it's ok for now!

Doubtless that Flexbox, CSS, JS will help make this website better but all good. 

My main focus here is to list a couple of recipes that i've personally cooked and tweaked here and there using the main HTML skills learnt:
1.Headers 
2.Ordered and Unordered lists 
3.Relative and absolute links including:
    1.Anchors with specific attributes (href)
    2.Images with specific attributes (src)
4.Most important! Ensure that the proper HTML boilerplate is added correctly and validating with an online validator. 

Hope you enjoy!
